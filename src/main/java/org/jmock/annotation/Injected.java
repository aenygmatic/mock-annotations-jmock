 * Injection priority
 * <ul>
 * <li>If two or more mock object can be injected to a field the closest by inheritance will be chosen</li>
 * <li>If two or more mock object has the same inheritance distance they will be selected by generic parameters</li>
 * <li>If two or more mock object left the mock will be injected by name (equals/equals lowercase)</li>
 * <li>If the mock cannot be selected by these rules the first mock will be chosen</li>
